This is an assignment from the UCSD Extension Coding Bootcamp. In this assignment we were tasked with coming up with a theme and applying it to a simple web browser based game app wherein the user has a limited amount of time after starting a play to answer a series of questions with multiple response answers. Upon completion and submission by the user with a button input or after time expiring, the user is then to be presented with a results page where they are informed how many questions they answered correctly, incorrectly and also how many they left unanswered. 

This assignment further compounded our ability to create a page using html and css from scratch, as well as provided more practice in both creating and targeting elements dynamically through the use of javascript and jQuery. New html elements such as radio buttons were critical in reaching the requirements of this task.
