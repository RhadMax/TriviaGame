Since it is allowed I will put all elements directly in html. Will start with results page and questions page as hidden elements via css. Javacsipt will add functionality of hiding/showing the html elements as needed by user. Each block of elemnts can be in a div with a class or id. Will need a setTimeInterval stored to a variable and then convert that var in a conversion function to show the timer. Will also need radio element selectors to choose only one option at a time. To confirm each is right we can use an object with a and q keys with stored arrays.
